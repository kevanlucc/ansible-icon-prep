# Pacemaker role for Ansible

This role configures Pacemaker cluster by dumping the configuration (CIB), adjusting the XML, and
reloading it. The role is idempotent, and supports check mode.

It has been redesigned to configure individual elements (cluster defaults, resources, groups,
constraints, etc) rather than the whole state of the cluster and all the services. This allows you
to focus on specific resources, without interfering with the rest.

## Requirements

This role has been written for and tested in Scientific Linux 7. It might also work in other
distros, please share your experience.

## Tasks

Use `tasks_from` Ansible directive to specify what you want to configure.

Boolean values in properties (parsed by Pacemaker itself) don't have to be quoted. However,
resource agents may expect Boolean-like arguments as integers, strings, etc. Such values **must**
be quoted.

### `tasks_from: main`

Set up nodes, configure cluster properties, and resource defaults.

#### `pcmk_cluster_name`

Name of the cluster (optional).

Default: `hacluster`.

#### `pcmk_password`

The plaintext password for the cluster user (optional). If omitted, will be derived from
`ansible_machine_id` of the first host in the play batch. This password is only used in the initial
authentication of the nodes.

Default: `ansible_machine_id | to_uuid`

#### `pcmk_user`

The system user to authenticate PCS nodes with (optional). PCS will authenticate all nodes with
each other.

Default: `hacluster`

#### `pcmk_cluster_options`

Dictionary with [cluster-wide options](https://clusterlabs.org/pacemaker/doc/en-US/Pacemaker/1.1/html/Pacemaker_Explained/s-cluster-options.html) (optional).

#### `pcmk_votequorum`

Dictionary with votequorum options (optional). See `votequorum(5)`. Boolean values accepted.

#### `pcmk_resource_defaults`

Dictionary of resource defaults (optional).

### `tasks_from: resource`

Configure a simple resource.

#### `pcmk_resource`

Dictionary describing a simple (*primitive*) resource. Contains the following members:

* `id`: resource identifier; mandatory for simple resources;
* `class`, `provider`, and `type`: resource agent descriptors; `provider` may be omitted, e.g. when
  `type` is `service`;
* `options`: optional dictionary of resource-specific attributes, e.g. address and netmask for
  *IPaddr2*;
* `op`: optional list of operations; each operation is a dictionary with required `name` and
  `interval` members, and optional arbitrary members;
* `meta`: optional dictionary of meta-attributes.

### `tasks_from: group`

Configure a resource group.

#### `pcmk_group`

Dictionary with two members:

* `id` is the group identifier
* `resources` is a dictionary where keys are resource IDs, and values have the same format as
  `pcmk_resource` (except for `id` of the resources being optional).

### `tasks_from: constraint`

Configure a constraint.

##### `pcmk_constraint`

Dictionary defining a single constraint. The following members are required:

* `type`: one of: `location`, `colocation`, or `order`;
* `score`: constraint score (signed integer, `INFINITY`, or `-INFINITY`).

Depending on the value of `type`, the following members are also required:

* `location` requires `rsc` and `node`;
* `colocation` requires `rsc` and `with-rsc`;
* `order` requires `first` and `then`;

The dictionary may contain other members, e.g. `symmetrical`.

### Nginx, web application, and master-slave Postgres

The cluster runs two Postgres nodes with synchronous replication. Wherever master is, a virtual IP
address is running, where NAT is pointing at. Nginx and the webapp are running at the same node, but
not the other, in order to save resources. Based on [the example from Clusterlabs
wiki](https://wiki.clusterlabs.org/wiki/PgSQL_Replicated_Cluster).
